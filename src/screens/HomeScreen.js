      Mathematics (from Ancient Greek μάθημα; máthēma: knowledge, study, learning) is an area of
      knowledge that includes such topics as numbers (arithmetic and number theory),[1] formulas and
      related structures (algebra),[2] shapes and the spaces in which they are contained
      (geometry),[1] and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis).[3][4][5] Most
      mathematical activity involves the use of pure reason to discover or prove the properties of
      abstract objects, which consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern
      mathematics—entities that are stipulated with certain properties, called axioms. A
      mathematical proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already
      known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from
      nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under
      consideration.
